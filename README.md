There area various parameters based on which the cost of living depends and their correlation plays a very important role in determining if that place in appropriate or not.

Used Nominatim & Rate Limiter from  Geopy library for extracting Latitude and Longitude of all locations.
<br><br>
Performed Feature Engineering i.e. creating new Input Features from the existing ones to improve the performance. Aggregated various the common features to create new features.
<br><br>
Figured out the Most & Least Expensive Countries.
<br><br>
Performed Geospatial Analysis that includes techniques which studied entities using their geographical properties. <br>
Made a bubble map on the base map using folium to understant various parameters on the map geographically. <br>
Utilized Heatmap function from seaborn library to understand correlation of factors (using corr function)
